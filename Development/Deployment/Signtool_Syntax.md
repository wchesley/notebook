## **Parameters**

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `command` | One of four commands that specifies an operation to perform on a file: `catdb`, `sign`, `timestamp`, or `verify`. For a description of each command, see the next table. |
| `options` | An option that modifies a command. In addition to the global `/q` and `/v` options, each command supports a unique set of options. |
| `file_name` | The path to the file to sign. |

SignTool supports the following commands:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `catdb` | Adds a catalog file to, or removes it from, a catalog database. 
Catalog databases are used for automatic lookup of catalog files and are
 identified by GUID. For a list of the options supported by the `catdb` command, see [catdb command options](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/signtool#catdb-command-options). |
| `remove` | Removes a signature from a file. For a list of the options supported by the `remove` command, see [remove command options](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/signtool#remove-command-options). |
| `sign` | Digitally signs files. Digital signatures protect files from 
tampering and enable users to verify the signer based on a signing 
certificate. For a list of the options supported by the `sign` command, see [sign command options](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/signtool#sign-command-options). |
| `timestamp` | Time stamps files. For a list of the options supported by the `timestamp` command, see [timestamp command options](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/signtool#timestamp-command-options). |
| `verify` | Verifies the digital signature of files. Determines whether the 
signing certificate was issued by a trusted authority, whether the 
signing certificate has been revoked, and, optionally, whether the 
signing certificate is valid for a specific policy. For a list of the 
options supported by the `verify` command, see [verify command options](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/signtool#verify-command-options). |

The following options apply to all SignTool commands:

| Global option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/q` | Displays no output if the command runs successfully, and displays minimal output if the command fails. |
| `/v` | Displays verbose output regardless of whether the command runs successfully or fails, and displays warning messages. |
| `/debug` | Displays debugging information. |

## **Catdb command options**

The following table lists the options that can be used with the `catdb` command:

| Catdb option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/d` | Specifies that the default catalog database is updated. If you don't use either `/d` or `/g`, SignTool updates the system component and driver database. |
| `/g` *GUID* | Specifies that the catalog database identified by the GUID is updated. |
| `/r` | Removes the specified catalog from the catalog database. If this 
option isn't specified, SignTool adds the specified catalog to the 
catalog database. |
| `/u` | Specifies that a unique name is automatically generated for the 
added catalog files. If necessary, the catalog files are renamed to 
prevent name conflicts with existing catalog files. If this option isn't
 specified, SignTool overwrites any existing catalog that has the same 
name as the specified catalog. |

> Note  
> Catalog databases are used for automatic lookup of catalog files.

## **Remove command options**

The following table lists the options that can be used with the `remove` command:

| Remove option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/c` | Remove all certificates, except for the signer certificate from the signature. |
| `/q` | No output on success and minimal output on failure. As always, SignTool returns `0` on success and `1` on failure. |
| `/s` | Remove the signature entirely. |
| `/u` | Remove the unauthenticated attributes from the signature e.g. dual signatures and timestamps. |
| `/v` | Print verbose success and status messages. This may also provide slightly more information on error. |

## **Sign command options**

The following table lists the options that can be used with the `sign` command:

| Sign command option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/a` | Automatically selects the best signing certificate. SignTool finds 
all valid certificates that satisfy all specified conditions and selects
 the one that is valid for the longest time. If this option isn't 
present, SignTool expects to find only one valid signing certificate. |
| `/ac` *file* | Adds another certificate from *file* to the signature block. |
| `/as` | Appends this signature. If no primary signature exists, this signature is made the primary signature instead. |
| `/c` *CertTemplateName* | Specifies the Certificate Template Name (a Microsoft extension) for the signing certificate. |
| `/csp` *CSPName* | Specifies the cryptographic service provider (CSP) that contains the private key container. |
| `/d` *Desc* | Specifies a description of the signed content. |
| `/dg` *Path* | Generates the digest to be signed and the unsigned PKCS7 files. The output digest and PKCS7 files are *<Path>\<FileName>.dig* and *<Path>\<FileName>.p7u*. To output an extra XML file, use `/dxml`. |
| `/di` *Path* | Creates the signature by ingesting the signed digest to the unsigned
 PKCS7 file. The input signed digest and unsigned PKCS7 files should be *<Path>\<FileName>.dig.signed* and *<Path>\<FileName>.p7u*. |
| `/dlib` *DLL* | Specifies the DLL that implements the `AuthenticodeDigestSign` function to sign the digest with. This option is equivalent to using SignTool separately with the `/dg`, `/ds`, and `/di` options. This option invokes all three as one atomic operation. |
| `/dmdf` *Filename* | When used with the `/dg` option, passes the fileâ€™s contents to the `AuthenticodeDigestSign` function without modification. |
| `/ds` | Signs the digest only. The input file should be the digest generated by the `/dg` option. The output file is: *<File>.signed*. |
| `/du` *URL* | Specifies a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the expanded description of the signed content. |
| `/dxml` | When used with the `/dg` option, produces an XML file. The output file is: *<Path>\<FileName>.dig.xml*. |
| `/f` *SignCertFile* | Specifies the signing certificate in a file. If the file is in 
Personal Information Exchange (PFX) format and protected by a password, 
use the `/p` option to specify the password. If the file doesn't contain private keys, use the `/csp` and `/kc` options to specify the CSP and private key container name. |
| `/fd` *alg* | Specifies the file digest algorithm to use for creating file signatures. **Note**: If the `/fd` option isn't specified while signing, the command generates an error. |
| `/fd certHash` | Specifying the string "certHash" causes the command to use the algorithm specified on the signing certificate. **Note**: If the `/fd` option isn't specified while signing, the command generates an error. |
| `/i` *IssuerName* | Specifies the name of the issuer of the signing certificate. This value can be a substring of the entire issuer name. |
| `/kc` *PrivKeyContainerName* | Specifies the private key container name. |
| `/n` *SubjectName* | Specifies the name of the subject of the signing certificate. This value can be a substring of the entire subject name. |
| `/nph` | If supported, suppresses page hashes for executable files. The default is determined by the **SIGNTOOL_PAGE_HASHES** environment variable and by the *wintrust.dll* version. This option is ignored for non-PE files. |
| `/p` *Password* | Specifies the password to use when opening a PFX file. Use the `/f` option to specify a PFX file. |
| `/p7` *Path* | Specifies that a Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #7 file is
 produced for each specified content file. PKCS #7 files are named *<path>\<filename>.p7*. |
| `/p7ce` *Value* | Specifies options for the signed PKCS #7 content. Set *Value* to `Embedded` to embed the signed content in the PKCS #7 file, or to `DetachedSignedData` to produce the signed data portion of a detached PKCS #7 file. If the `/p7ce` option isn't specified, the signed content is embedded by default. |
| `/p7co` *<OID>* | Specifies the object identifier (OID) that identifies the signed PKCS #7 content. |
| `/ph` | If supported, generates page hashes for executable files. |
| `/r` *RootSubjectName* | Specifies the name of the subject of the root certificate that the 
signing certificate must chain to. This value can be a substring of the 
entire subject name of the root certificate. |
| `/s` *StoreName* | Specifies the store to open when the command searches for the 
certificate. If this option isn't specified, the command opens the `My` store. |
| `/sha1` *Hash* | Specifies the SHA1 hash of the signing certificate. The SHA1 hash is
 commonly used when multiple certificates satisfy the criteria specified
 by the remaining options. |
| `/sm` | Specifies that the command uses a machine store, instead of a user store. |
| `/t` *URL* | Specifies the URL of the time stamp server. If this option or `/tr`
 isn't specified, the signed file isn't time stamped. If time stamping 
fails, the command generates a warning. This option can't be used with 
the `/tr` option. |
| `/td` *alg* | Used with the `/tr` option to request a digest algorithm used by the RFC 3161 time stamp server. **Note**: If `/td` isn't specified while time stamping, the command generates an error. |
| `/tr` *URL* | Specifies the URL of the RFC 3161 time stamp server. If this option or `/t`
 isn't specified, the signed file isn't time stamped. If the time 
stamping fails, the command generates a warning. This option can't be 
used with the `/t` option. |
| `/u` *Usage* | Specifies the enhanced key usage (EKU) that must be present in the 
signing certificate. The usage value can be specified by OID or string. 
The default usage is `Code Signing` or  `1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3`. |
| `/uw` | Specifies usage of `Windows System Component Verification` or `1.3.6.1.4.1.311.10.3.6`. |

For usage examples, see [Using SignTool to Sign a File](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/using-signtool-to-sign-a-file).

## **Timestamp command options**

The following table lists the options that can be used with the `timestamp` command:

| Timestamp option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/p7` | Time stamps PKCS #7 files. |
| `/t` *URL* | Specifies the URL of the time stamp server. The file being time stamped must have previously been signed. Either the `/t` or the `/tr` option is required. |
| `/td` *alg* | Used with the `/tr` option to request a digest algorithm used by the RFC 3161 time stamp server. **Note**: If `/td` isn't specified while time stamping, the command generates a warning. |
| `/tp` *index* | Time stamps the signature at *index*. |
| `/tr` *URL* | Specifies the URL of the RFC 3161 time stamp server. The file being time stamped must have previously been signed. Either the `/tr` or the `/t` option is required. |

## **Verify command options**

The following table lists the options that can be used with the `verify` command:

| Verify option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/a` | Specifies that all methods can be used to verify the file. First, 
SignTool searches the catalog databases to determine whether the file is
 signed in a catalog. If the file isn't signed in any catalog, SignTool 
attempts to verify the file's embedded signature. We recommend this 
option when verifying files that might or might not be signed in a 
catalog. Examples of files that might or might not be signed include 
Windows files or drivers. |
| `/ad` | Finds the catalog by using the default catalog database. |
| `/all` | Verifies all signatures in a file with multiple signatures. |
| `/as` | Finds the catalog by using the system component (driver) catalog database. |
| `/ag` *CatDBGUID* | Finds the catalog in the catalog database identified by the GUID. |
| `/c` *CatFile* | Specifies the catalog file by name. |
| `/d` | Prints the description and description URL. WindowsÂ Vista and earlier: This option isn't supported. |
| `/ds` *Index* | Verifies the signature at a certain position. |
| `/hash`{*SHA1*|*SHA256*} | Specifies an optional hash algorithm to use when searching for a file in a catalog. |
| `/kp` | Performs the verification by using the x64 kernel-mode driver signing policy. |
| `/ms` | Uses multiple verification semantics. This behavior is the default of a [WinVerifyTrust](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/Wintrust/nf-wintrust-winverifytrust) call. |
| `/o` *Version* | Verifies the file by operating system version. The version parameter is of the form: *<PlatformID>:<VerMajor>.<VerMinor>.<BuildNumber>*. We recommend the use of the `/o` option. If `/o` isn't specified, SignTool might return unexpected results. For example, if you don't include `/o`,
 then system catalogs that validate correctly on an older operating 
system might not validate correctly on a newer operating system. |
| `/p7` | Verifies PKCS #7 files. No existing policies are used for PKCS #7 
validation. SignTool checks the signature and builds a chain for the 
signing certificate. |
| `/pa` | Specifies that the Default Authentication Verification Policy is used. If the `/pa` option isn't specified, SignTool uses the Windows Driver Verification Policy. This option can't be used with the `catdb` options. |
| `/pg` *PolicyGUID* | Specifies a verification policy by GUID. The GUID corresponds to the `ActionID` of the verification policy. This option can't be used with the `catdb` options. |
| `/ph` | Print and verify page hash values. WindowsÂ Vista and earlier: This option isn't supported. |
| `/r` *RootSubjectName* | Specifies the name of the subject of the root certificate that the 
signing certificate must chain to. This value can be a substring of the 
entire subject name of the root certificate. |
| `/tw` | Specifies that the command generates a warning if the signature isn't time stamped. |

The SignTool `verify` command determines whether the 
signing certificate was issued by a trusted authority, whether the 
signing certificate has been revoked, and, optionally, whether the 
signing certificate is valid for a specific policy.

The SignTool `verify` command outputs the embedded signature status unless an option is specified to search a catalog, such as `/a`, `/ad`, `/as`, `/ag`, or `/c`.

## **Return value**

SignTool returns one of the following exit codes when it terminates:

| Exit code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Execution was successful. |
| `1` | Execution has failed. |
| `2` | Execution has completed with warnings. |
