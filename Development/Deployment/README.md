# Deployment

**Software deployment** is all of the activities that make a [software system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_system "Software system") available for use.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_deployment#cite_note-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_deployment#cite_note-2)

The general deployment process consists of several interrelated activities with possible transitions between them. These activities can occur on the [producer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_developer "Software developer") side or on the [consumer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_(computing) "User (computing)") side or both. Because every software system is unique, the precise [processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing) "Process (computing)") or [procedures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") within each activity can hardly be defined. Therefore, "deployment" should be interpreted as a _general process_ that has to be customized according to specific requirements or characteristics.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_deployment#cite_note-3)

Typically this boils down to getting the working code from your machine to the customer's machine, where the customer could be a server or an end user. The code must live somewhere others can interact with it.
