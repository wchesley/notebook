# Overview

## Problem Statement

A brief description of the problem we're trying to solve. Why is this valuable to work on? 

Bytebot has outgrown nodejs, node doesn't handle async/await very well ergo I'm migrating to a platform with more support for it, python.  

## Proposed Work

A high-level overview of what we're building and why it will solve the problem.

Rewrite application to in python rather than nodejs. Barebones code is in place thanks to AlexFlipnote ([https://github.com/AlexFlipnote/discord_bot.py](https://github.com/AlexFlipnote/discord_bot.py))
