SHORT DESCRIPTION
	Provides a function for logging messages with standardized formatting and severity levels in PowerShell scripts and modules.

LONG DESCRIPTION
	The LogMsg module offers a single function, LogMsg, which enables users to log messages with a consistent format, including a timestamp and severity level. It supports Information, Warning, and Error levels, as well as standard output (stdout) when no severity is specified. This module is useful for adding structured logging to scripts, making it easier to track execution and troubleshoot issues.

	The LogMsg function accepts the following parameters:
	-Message (required): The message to log. Aliases: msg, m.
	-Level (optional): The severity level (Information, Warning, Error). Aliases: lvl, l. If omitted, the message is written to standard output.

	The output includes a timestamp in the format [MM-DD-YYYY HH:mm:ss] preceding the message.

EXAMPLES
	# Log an informational message
	LogMsg -Message "This is an informational message." -Level Information

	# Log a warning message
	LogMsg -Message "This is a warning." -Level Warning

	# Log an error message
	LogMsg -Message "This is an error." -Level Error

	# Log a message to standard output (no severity)
	LogMsg -Message "This is a normal message."
