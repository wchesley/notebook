### Roleplaying Notes for Bazaq:

**Core Concept:** Bazaq is a charismatic and dangerously clever individual who has turned to forbidden powers to elevate himself beyond the station of a common grifter. He is a walking contradiction: one moment a silken-tongued flatterer, the next a font of biting sarcasm. His entire worldview is built on the idea that he is always the smartest person in the room, a belief reinforced by his pact with a powerful Fiend. This supreme confidence is both his greatest asset and his most exploitable weakness. He owes a debt to a shady mentor from his past, suggesting that even a self-made man like Bazaq has strings attached.

**Verbal Style:**
* **Vocabulary:** Bazaq's vocabulary is a tool. When trying to get his way (using flattery), his language becomes flowery, erudite, and complimentary, drawing on his decent Intelligence (13) and high Charisma (17). When on the offensive (using insults), his words become sharp, precise, and cruel, weaponizing his high Intimidation (+5) and Deception (+5) skills. He'd know just the right arcane term (from his Arcana proficiency) to make someone feel small and ignorant.
* **Tone:** His tone shifts dramatically with his mood and objective. It can be warm, engaging, and almost purring when he's trying to charm someone. However, it can turn instantly cold, condescending, and laced with threat when he feels challenged or is asserting dominance.
* **Conversational Focus:** Conversations are always about control. He will steer the topic to his advantage, using flattery to disarm and insults to provoke. He is likely fascinated by discussions of power, magic (especially forbidden lore), and opportunities for personal gain. His bond suggests he might occasionally, and perhaps cryptically, mention his "old teacher."
* **Sentence Structure:** Sentences are well-constructed and deliberate. When flattering, they are longer and more complex. When intimidating, they become short, sharp, and impactful.

**Mannerisms (Guidance):**
* **Overconfidence:** Bazaq likely carries himself with an unshakeable poise. He rarely breaks eye contact and might have a subtle, knowing smirk permanently etched on his face. His flaw—believing no one could fool him—means he might dismiss others' attempts at deception out of hand, not with suspicion, but with a condescending chuckle.
* **Dual Nature:** When switching from flattery to insult, his whole posture might change. He could lean in conspiratorially when being charming, then lean back with his arms crossed when being dismissive and sarcastic. This physical shift telegraphs his verbal attack.
* **Infernal Heritage:** As a Tiefling with a Fiend pact, there might be subtle tells. When he uses *Eldritch Blast*, perhaps a faint scent of brimstone fills the air. When he's angry, the ambient light might seem to dim slightly around him, a subconscious use of his innate *Thaumaturgy*.
* **Sleight of Hand:** His proficiency in Sleight of Hand (+4) suggests he is never idle. He might constantly be fiddling with a coin, his weighted dice, or some other small object, his hands moving with a practiced, distracting grace.


# Curse of Strahd

Madam Eva's Cards:  
**The Tome of Strahd**: With the Abbot in the Abbey of Saint Markovia.

**The Holy Symbol of Ravenkind**: With Sergei von Zarovich in his tomb.

**The Sunsword**: Hidden in the lair of the werewolves.

**Your Ally**: An imprisoned man in the dungeons of Castle Ravenloft.

**Your Final Confrontation**: In Sergei's tomb within Castle Ravenloft.

Attempted to persuade the werewolves into fighting Strahd, which failed miserably, we almost lost Ismark in our escape, but managed to throw the werewolves off our trail thanks to Bazaq's use of Thaumaturgy. Next time the party approaches the Den, they'll bring magical or silver weapons, then they will wait for the pack to go hunting before entering the den to retreive the Sunsword.

The party has camped near the crossroads where we went off the main road in search of the werewolves den. 

The next day, the party heads out for the Village of Krezk and the abby that overlooks the village. They were approached by Strahd's carrage, seeing the obvious trap, and knowing Stahd, the party didn't outright decline the invitation, rather post poned it with a carefully thought out note Bazaq wrote and tossed into the carriage. The party heads now towards the town of Vallaki in search of magical weapons or silver they can use in their fight against Strahd. 

The party has arrived at the Village of Vallaki and Ismarks name got us in the gates. The village is in a bizzare state, the party was ordered that there is to be no unhappieness in Vallaki. The party does their best to blend in and find the Blue Water Inn and rest for the night. Bazaq kept a wary eye out while the party searched for the inn, he noticed signs posted around town advertising the "Festival of the Blazing Sun" where attendance is mandatory. The sign also stated that "malicous unhappieness" is punisable by time in the stocks. Bazaq noticed the Baron's 'secret' guards in the city streets as they repremanded another citizen for not smiling. Bazaq briefly saw a Vistani woman from the village of Borovia, she worked at the Blood of the Vine Inn. The Vistani was seen giving a note to a strange man in a feathered hat who disappeard after getting the note. Once the Vistani woman saw Bazaq, she too disappeared in the crowd. The party found the Blue Water Inn shortly afterwards and acquired accomodations, food and drink. 

While sitting in the tavern's common room, Bazaq was able to discern some information from the Inn's other patrons:  
**From a pair of grim-faced men in leather armor at a corner table**: "...another shipment from the Wizard of Wines is late. Danika's running low on the good stuff. Something's wrong on the road south. Not just wolves this time."

**From a hushed conversation between two women near the fire:** "...and little Arabelle is still missing. Her father, Luvash, over at the Vistani camp is fit to be tied. Says he'll pay anything to get her back. Last seen down by Lake Zarovich."

**From a richly dressed merchant complaining to a friend:** "Three days until the Festival of the Blazing Sun, and the Baron is insisting on even more decorations. My savings are being bled dry for this mandatory joy. And I've heard strange noises from the coffin maker's shop at night... best to stay away from that place."

After eating, when Urwin Dorakova (Owner of Inn, wife: Danika) came to clear the plates he was keen on the parties reason for comming to Vallaki. He told the party of the Baron Vargas Vallakovich, how the Baron believes that if you ignore evil, it will simpily disappear. So the Baron puts up a facade of happieness in a vain attempt to fight evil. We learned of The town smith is named Gunther Arasek. His shop, the 'Arasek Stockyard,' is near the west gate of Vallaki. Urwin told us silver is rare, but if anyone knows, it would be Gunther. Urwin made a suggestion if we need "anything else", hinting at more than just food and drink...probably sex but we need information. 

Ireena suggested we acquire some good will before aproaching the Baron. Bazaq let Ireena and Ismark sleep while he went and scouted the Coffin Maker's shop. Bazaq was able to traverse the town undetected and confirm the rumor about the shop. There is a wailing woman on the second floor and the sound of rhythmic thumping. Bazaq returned to the Inn without issue, slept while he could and in the morning relayed the information to the party. The party decided to take the long route to the Baron's mansion to investigate the Coffin Shop during the day, while it's open to speak with the owner. 

The following morning the coffin shop is open and the party heads inside. Upon entry, Ismark calls out to the owner, but we receive no answer, yet the party hears the woman crying and the rhythmic thumping from upstairs. Just as the party was about to leave, Henrik van der Voort, the coffin maker responds to the party, he is sweaty, claims the shop is closed for the day, he is clearly hiding something. Henrik is cautious of the party, he doesn't want us to cause trouble nor bring trouble to him. 

With a calm, friendly tone Bazaq claims he heard the woman crying while on the street and stepped into the shop to ensure everything was ok. After asking the question Bazaq gives Henrik a pointed look that say's "I know you're hiding something"
