# Introduction to Microsoft 365 for IT Administrators

Microsoft 365 is a unified platform for productivity, collaboration, and security. IT administrators use Microsoft 365 to centrally manage users, devices, and services across their organization.

Microsoft Graph API is the primary interface for automating and integrating Microsoft 365 services, including Exchange Online, SharePoint, and Teams. Administrators can use the Microsoft Graph .NET SDK to build applications or scripts, and the `Microsoft.Graph` PowerShell module to automate tasks from the command line.

Leveraging Microsoft Graph with .NET and PowerShell enables efficient, programmatic management of Microsoft 365 environments.
