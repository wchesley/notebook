# Auto-Upload Android Client
Ran into some issues with auto-upload on the android client. Since they removed logs in the app the process was *that* much more painful to troubleshoot and nail down. 

The error message from adb was as follows: 
`07-29 10:59:38.753 32414 32460 V NativeCrypto: SSL handshake aborted: ssl=0x79bafb7e08: Failure in SSL library, usually a protocol error
07-29 10:59:38.753 32414 32460 V NativeCrypto: error:1000042e:SSL routines:OPENSSL_internal:TLSV1_ALERT_PROTOCOL_VERSION (third_party/openssl/boringssl/src/ssl/tls_record.cc:594 0x79bafd3988:0x00000001)`

I tried a number of things to solve this, learned the hard way that apache doesn't support TLSv1.3, or I don't have it enabled in the conf. When I went to enable it for the site, the configtest passed but apache wouldn't start. Also disabled SSLStapling

What finally resolved this was actually removing the call to TLSv1.2...dont' know why it was choosing to complain about TLSv1 in the error message. I found this by comparing my `nextcloud.conf` to a generic config [generated by mozilla](https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/#server=apache&version=2.4.41&config=intermediate&openssl=1.1.1d&ocsp=false&guideline=5.6)
