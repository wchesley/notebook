Structure and Organization
**Design a Clear OU Structure:** .

Establish
 separate Organizational Units (OUs) for different user types and 
computer types and use nested OUs for granular control.
**Link GPOs at the OU Level:** .

Apply GPOs to specific OUs instead of the domain root for better control and isolation.
**Use Smaller, Focused GPOs:** .

Create
 multiple small GPOs, each addressing a specific topic (e.g., network 
policy, software policy), to simplify administration and management.
**Follow a Consistent Naming Policy:** .

Give your GPOs descriptive names to make them easily identifiable and understandable.
**Add Comments to GPOs:** .

Document the purpose of each GPO and the settings within it by adding comments to enhance clarity for future administrators.


Policy Management & Precedence
**Do Not Modify Default Policies:** Avoid making changes to the Default Domain Policy and Default Domain Controller Policy.**Use Inheritance and Avoid Blocking:** Leverage GPO inheritance and avoid blocking policy inheritance or using policy
enforcement, as this can lead to unexpected behavior and complex
troubleshooting.**Delete GPO Links, Not the GPO:** Instead of disabling a GPO, delete the link from the OU if you no longer want it to apply; disabling a GPO stops it from being processed everywhere in the domain.**Understand GPO Precedence:** Be aware of the order of GPO processing to predict how settings will be
applied when multiple GPOs are linked to the same OU or object.

Performance & Troubleshooting
**Disable Unused Configurations:** .

Speed up GPO processing by disabling computer and user configurations that are not needed.
**Use WMI Filters Sparingly:** .

While WMI filters offer advanced targeting, overuse can slow down GPO processing.
**Back Up Your GPOs:** .

Regularly back up your Group Policy Objects to ensure you can recover them if necessary.
**Implement Change Management:** .

Establish a process for managing and tracking changes to your GPO settings to maintain security and control.

**Monitor GPO Performance:** .

Use tools like

```
gpresult
```

to troubleshoot issues and monitor the processing of your Group Policies.

And whatever you do, don’t mess with the default domain policy or default domain controllers policy. Leave that default. Nothing at the top of the domain except default domain policy.

I typically have two approaches

Create baseline templates

All devices (applies to every device) pinned at the top level OUs with devices

COMPANY Domain controllers - For the customer domain controllers policy

COMPANY PDC - Custom policy for the PDC

All windows devices (windows servers and workstations) pinned at the top level that contains all windows workstations and all windows servers

All Linux devices

All windows workstations - Pinned at the OUs contained windows workstations

All Linux workstations

All windows servers - Pinned where the OU is for windows servers

All Linux servers

All People - Pinned where all of the users top OU are

All employees - Pinned where the employees ou is

All contractors - Pinned where the contractors OU is

And you basically try to only use those policies and avoid one-offs. So if you need to scope a policy to a group you use item-level targeting. If you can’t, you question if you really need it.

The other approach is to group policies by function.

You sill have baseline policies but you group things like

Standard windows workstation security baseline

Standard windows server security baseline

Standard windows workstation application policy
