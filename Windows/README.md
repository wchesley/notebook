## .msix files and how to open them

These are basically a fancy wrapper around a `.zip` file, which contains all the applications data and `.xml` configuration files, which are required for installation. To view the contents of any `.msix` file, rename the file extension to `.zip` and decompress as normal. Ensure you keep a copy of the original `.msix` file or the `.zip` file if you intend to install or use the software inside. You can freely convert a `.zip` file back into it's `.msix` file by changing the extension once again. 

## Brute-force get cli args of exe? (untested)
Have a vendor executable with unknown command-line options? Don’t want to reverse-engineer? Brute force in Windows shell!

```
:: Extract strings from program
strings.exe program.exe >> strings.txt

:: Run each string as program argument
for /f %a IN (strings.txt) DO “program.exe” %a
```

## Disable BitLocker automatic device encryption

OEMs can choose to disable device encryption and instead implement their own encryption technology on a device. To disable BitLocker automatic device encryption, you can use an Unattend file and set [PreventDeviceEncryption](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/customize/desktop/unattend/microsoft-windows-securestartup-filterdriver-preventdeviceencryption) to True.

Alternately, you can update the **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\BitLocker** registry key:

Value: **PreventDeviceEncryption** equal to True (1).
