## General use: 
- list items with `dir` instead of `ls`
- can still change directory with `cwd`
- Can still pipe out put `| > >>`
- No `grep` but there is `findstr`
	- `set | findstr -i xdclientname`
		- Where `-i` makes for a case insensitive search 
- `tracert` is akin to `traceroute`

NFS - if installed on windows see [this](./windows-nfs) for more
- `rpcinfo`
- `mount`

View all env vars set for a system: 
- `set`
