# ByteBot
A discord bot I "built", well [AlexFlipnote](https://github.com/AlexFlipnote/discord_bot.py) started it and I added onto it. See the [proposal](./Proposal.md) for more information on what I added. Essentially I integrated the bot with a Valheim server. 
Discord.py is officially depreciated and not receiving anymore updates from the original maintainer, nor is he passing the mantle down to another maintainer. I've opted to migrate to [pycord](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord) though am not sure if I will update Bytebot to support Discord's slash commands. More info on discord.py's depreciation can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/4a2f62751b9600a31a0d3c78100287f1)
