# Book Review
List of books read, my thoughts and opinions on them. List is unsorted, books are added as I've read them and actually sat down to write something. 

## Neuromancer - William Gibbson (Sprawl Trilogy pt. 1)
- First read Q1 of 2022, book was written in 1984


## Count Zer0 - William Gibbson (Sprawl Trilogy pt. 2)
- First read Q2 of 2022, book was written in 1986
So far, the most confusing of the trilogy, I felt like I was left with more questions than answers. Book continues in the same world as Neuromancer, but about 7-8 years past the events of the first book. Only one recurring character from Neuromancer appears in this book, *The Finn*. The book follows 3 different characters, Bobby Newmark, Turner and Marly Krushkhova. The 3 'main' characters stories are all related, even if the characters aren't aware of it. I would argue the book follows Turner the closest as he works for the Hosaka corporation to recruit (steal) the top researcher of Mass-Biolabs. The deal went south and the characters are mostly left up to their own devices to survive the fallout from both corps. All along there are "voodoo gods" within the matrix, console cowboys are somewhat aware of them, but most won't talk about it. A whole religion has formed around these 'gods' (book eludes they are the reminents of Wintermute and Neuromancer from teh first book). Bobby Newmarks ends up running with a few fanatic followers of the religion, Lucas, and Beauvoir and Jackie, after his near-death experience with some new ice he was testing for a fence, Two-a-day. Bobby was only saved by the image of a girl, shrouded in light, who disconnected him from the ice/biochip just before he flatlined.
