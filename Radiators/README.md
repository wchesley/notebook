# Radiators

mostly notes and research from a project for a Radiator Manufacturing Company. 

# Notes
Ordered is required as well as Purchase  
Serial numbers are generated on work order creation, should be sequential following last one created.   
Folder Complete bool means drawing is done.   
so long is shipped is less than scheduled, WO stays on the reports. else it's taken off.
