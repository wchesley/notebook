# Power

Need to check outlet locations relative to shelf placement, route power accordingly. 
Migrate UPS to Garage - Router / Modem will be tied to this UPS, nothing else on it's battery power. 
Dual powerstrips?! One for each server? if current hardware allows...Else Servers on single strip. 
Future plans ideally include a UPS for rack mounted servers, maybe a 240v plug for a full rack. 

6/29/2021: Verified two outlets that can reach the 'rack', both appear to be on the same circuit. I feel that in the beginning, the UPS should be for the router and storage server.
