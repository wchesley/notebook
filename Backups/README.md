# Backups

Backups are important, more so than most believe at first until they lose their data. Take backups of anything you can't afford to lose or is irrecoverable. Follow the 3-2-1 strategy of backups and it's near impossible for you to lose anything. 

What's contained here are notes about my backups and notes about backups and backup strategies. Follow at your own risk and always, always verify your backups before it's too late!
