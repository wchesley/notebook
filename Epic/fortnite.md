# Fortnite
I regret to have these notes, but it's needed as I'll forget between uses and this *should* be done correctly. 

# Signing into Winston's account in web browser
- Choose sign in as Nintendo account
- Sign in with my gmail account
- Should then redirect and show Winston's username, confirm username on switch to be sure. 
- Should now be signed in as Winston's account in a web browser for either epicgames.com or fortnite.com under his switch account. PSN account is tied to my gmail login for epic games.
