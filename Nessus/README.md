Nessus is a proprietary vulnerability scanner developed by Tenable, Inc. 

n 1998 Renaud Deraison created The Nessus Project as a free remote security scanner. On October 5 2005, with the release of Nessus 3, the project changed from the GNU Public License to a proprietary license.

The Nessus 2 engine and some of the plugins are still using the GNU Public License, leading to forks based on Nessus like OpenVAS and Greenbone Sustainable Resilience.
