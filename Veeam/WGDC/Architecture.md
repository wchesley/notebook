Client site's will backup to two locations: Local and Offsite (Data Center). 
1. Local backups are on a NAS
2. Offsite backups are at Westgate Data Center

Connecting to a DC Repo to do a restore: 
- What machine do I need to be on? 
- Do I need to connect to 1 of the 3 repos that the customer is also on? 
- Login Credentials?
