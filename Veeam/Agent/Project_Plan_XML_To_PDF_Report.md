# Project Plan: Veeam XML to PDF Report Generator

## 1. Project Overview
**Project Name:** Veeam XML to PDF Report Generator  
**Objective:** Develop a .NET 8.0 console application that processes XML reports from Veeam Agents and generates structured PDF reports. Future versions will support Veeam Backup & Replication Console.  

## 2. Scope
### **Phase 1 - Initial Development**
- Parse XML reports generated by Veeam Agents.
- Extract relevant backup job details.
- Generate structured PDF reports.
- Implement SOLID principles and best practices.
- Establish a structured version control strategy using Git and GitHub.

### **Phase 2 - Enhancements**
- Add support for Veeam Backup & Replication Console XML reports.
- Improve PDF report customization (branding, themes, etc.).
- Implement logging, error handling, and configuration management.
- Optimize CI/CD workflows for automated builds and deployments.

### **Phase 3 - Optimization & Deployment**
- Performance tuning (handling large XML files efficiently).
- Provide options for CLI parameters to customize reports.
- Package and distribute as a deployable application.
- Ensure adherence to semantic versioning.

## 3. Technology Stack
- **Framework:** .NET 8.0 (C#)
- **Libraries:**
  - XML Parsing: `System.Xml.Linq`
  - PDF Generation: `QuestPDF`
  - Logging: `Serilog`
  - Dependency Injection: `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`
  - Configuration Management: `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration`
- **Version Control:**
  - Repository: GitHub
  - Branching Strategy: `main` (stable releases), `develop` (ongoing development), feature branches per task.
  - Commit Standard: Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, etc.).
  - Versioning Standard: Semantic Versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).

## 4. System Architecture
### **High-Level Design**
1. **Input Module:**
   - Reads XML reports from a specified directory or file.
   - Validates XML format and schema compliance.
2. **Processing Module:**
   - Extracts relevant data from XML reports.
   - Formats extracted data for reporting.
3. **PDF Generation Module:**
   - Uses extracted data to generate structured PDF reports.
   - Supports styling and branding customization.
4. **Logging & Error Handling Module:**
   - Logs events, warnings, and errors for troubleshooting.
   - Provides user-friendly error messages.
5. **CLI Interface:**
   - Allows users to specify input XML file and output PDF location.
   - Supports optional parameters (e.g., custom branding, output format).

## 5. Development Timeline
| Phase | Tasks | Duration |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase 1 | Core XML Parsing & PDF Generation | 4 Weeks |
| Phase 2 | Veeam B&R Support & Enhancements | 4 Weeks |
| Phase 3 | Optimization & Deployment | 3 Weeks |

## 6. SOLID Principles Implementation
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Separate concerns into distinct classes (e.g., XML Parser, PDF Generator, CLI Handler).
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Use interfaces and abstractions to allow future extensions.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Ensure derived classes adhere to base class contracts.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Design small, specific interfaces rather than large, general ones.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** Rely on abstractions rather than concrete implementations (DI using `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`).

## 7. Risks & Mitigation Strategies
| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| Large XML file sizes impact performance | Implement streaming-based XML parsing |
| PDF formatting issues | Use a reliable PDF library and test extensively |
| Handling different XML structures | Implement schema validation and adaptable parsing |
| Version control conflicts | Enforce Git branching strategy and code reviews |

## 8. Future Considerations
- Export reports in other formats (e.g., CSV, JSON).
- Develop a GUI-based version for wider usability.
- Implement scheduled automated report generation.
- Extend CI/CD to include automated testing and release tagging.

## 9. Next Steps
1. Define XML schema variations for Veeam Agent and B&R reports.
2. Develop a prototype for XML parsing and PDF generation.
3. Set up CI/CD for automated testing and deployment.
4. Establish GitHub repository with initial project structure.
5. Define contribution guidelines for developers.
