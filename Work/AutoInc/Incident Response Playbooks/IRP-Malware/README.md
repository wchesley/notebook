## 1. Preparation

<details>
<summary>Expand/Colapse</summary>

- [ ] Create and maintain a list of 
    - all domains owned by Company.
        - This can prevent you from taking actions against our own domains
    - all people of can register domains
- [ ] Create email template 
    - to notify all employees of ongoing phishing campaing against the organization 
    - to contact hosting companies for domain take down
    - to inform 3rd party to take actions against phishing on there infra (Microsoft, Fedex, Apple, etc.)
- [ ] Ensure that:
    - [ ] Mail anti-malware/anti-spam/anti-phish solutions are in place.
    - [ ] Users know how to report phish
    - [ ] Detection exists for office documents spawning processes
        - PowerShell
        - CMD
        - WMI
        - MSHTA
        - Etc.
- [ ] Perform Firedrill to ensure all aspects of the Playbook are working
    - After publication
    - At least once a year
    - Test/Validate: 
        - Internal Contact and Escalation Paths
          - Validate contact details (email and phone number at least)
          - Confirm users in escalation path. Are they still in this position, has anyone been added to the escalation path, do we still have good contact information for users in the escalation path? Are there alternates in case someone in the escalation path cannot be reached or is unavailable? 
- [ ] Review threat intelligence for: 
    - threats to the organisation, 
    - brands and the sector, 
    - common patterns 
    - newly developing risks and vulnerabilities
- [ ] Ensure  appropriate  access  to  any  necessary  documentation  and  information, including out-of-hours access, for the following
    - IR Playbooks to highlight information security risks faced by employees, including: 
      - Phishing;
      - Malware;
      - Ransomware;
      - PUP/Adware (Potentially Unwanted Program)
      - Reporting a suspected cyber incident.

</details>

### MD5. Is it a Ransomware ?
As time is VERY sensitive in the case of a Ransomware:  
- Send a communication to the Security Mailing List
- Ping everyone in the Security Teams Chat
- Go to the [Ransomware Playbook](../IRP-Ransomware/README.md)
    - If the Playbook doesn't exist, follow this one

### MD6. Is it a Worm ?
As time is sensitive in the case of a Worm:  
- Send a communication to the Security Mailing List
- Ping everyone in the Security Teams Chat
- Isolate the machine in [Microsoft Defender](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/respond-machine-alerts).

    - That have the registry keys
    - Any other IOCs found, if the name of the malware flavor is known, do research on it's typical behavior, validate this against the infected machine.

### MD8. Is it a False Positive?

If it's a False Positive:  
- Document and close the incident

If it's a True Positive:  
- Send communication to
    - Security Team

### MP9. Calculate Incident's Cost
<details open>
<summary>Expand/Colapse</summary>

Can we put a dollar value on this incident? How much did this cost the company? This is not including any potentially siphoned funds from the malware incident unless a ransom was paid. We do not recommend paying the ransom in any case as there is no garuntee the data will be decrypted and no garuntee the data won't be sold anyways. 

Consider:  
- Missed Sales
- Employee's unable to work during incident
- Time spent on investigation, remediation and monitoring
