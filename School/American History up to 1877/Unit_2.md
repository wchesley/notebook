## The English Background
England began to differ from it's European neighbors government types with the Magna Carta in 1215 A.D. This made England a nation ruled by laws, everyone was equal before the law and no one was above it. This created Parliment and it's two sub houses, the hereditary and appointed members of the House of Lords and teh elected members of the House of Commons. Most important power given to Parliment was the authority to impose taxes. By controlling tax revenue, teh legislature exercised leverage over the monarchy. 

## Religious Conflict and War - In England
When Queen Elizabeth died with no direct heir in 1603, the throne passed to her cousin James VI of Scotland, who became King James I. He thought he ruled by "divine right", answering only to God, whereas Queen Elizabeth ruled through constitutional authority. 

Facing a religious fueled civil war, the catholic babtized King James, sided with his church and sought to ban the Puritans from England. Attending Anglican church services was required by law in England, Puritians resisted this forming their own congregations, earning the nickname *Separatists*. In the late 16<sup>th</sup> century these Separatists were "hunted and persecuted on every side." Most left England as a result, sailing for America in hopes of forming colonies that better suited their religous and governmental beliefs.

James I was succeeded by his son Charles I in 1625. Charles I had a stronger view on absolute royal power. He Raised taxes without consulting Parliment, harrassed the Puritians, and even disbanded Parliment from 1629 to 1640. Charles I went too far when imposing religous laws on the Scotts who rose in rebelion in 1638. In despiration, Charles I reformed Parliment to raise taxes for defense of his Kingdom, but the militant Puritans who ran Parilment, refused. 

Charles I screwed up further in 1642, attempting to arrest 5 Parliment members ignighted a civil war. The parliamentary forces (Puritans), lead by Oliver Cromwell caputured Charles I, and in a public trial, covicted him of high treason and beheaded him in 1649. Cromwell did not yield his power, rather became a military dictator, calling himself Lord Protector. He outlawed Roman Catgholics and Anglicans, most escaped to America. 

Cromwell died in 1658, the army allowed for new elections for parliment and in 1660, supported teh restoration of the monarchy under Charles II, eldest son of the executed king. Charles II agreed to rule jointly wiht Parliment, but his younger brother, who became King James II in 1685, was more rigid. James openly embraced Catholicism, murdered or imprisoned political opponents and defied Parliment. 

English people were ok with James II as he had no heir, until a son was born in 1688. This sparked outrage that could have been anther civil war, but Political, relgious and military leaders urged the king's daughter Mary and her Protestant husband, William II of Orange (ruling Dutch Prince). A month after Mary and William landed in England with a huge army, James II fled to France. 

This dramatic transfer of power solidified Parliments right to counterbalance the authority of the monarchy. Kings and Queens could no longer suspend members of Parliment, create armies or impose taxes without Parliments consent. The monarchy would hence forth derive it's power from the people through their representatives in Parliment and not God's "divine right". 

## American Colonies

### People and Profits  
Seeing the riches Spain brought back to the new world Englad was hungry for it. Rather than all the riches going to the Monarachy as they had in Spain; American colonies were funded by joint-stock-companies. Investors would pool money together to fund a colony, shoudl the colony fail, no one investor takes the full loss, and if it' successful, each investor shares in the profit. This idea of riches while minimalizing risk is one of the most important innovations of the 'Age of Exploration'.  
### Self-Sustaining Colonies  
England's colonies population far surpassed that of the Dutch French, and Spanish. in 1660, there were 58,000 people in the England colonies of New Englad, Virginia and Maryland; whereas the Ducth had 5,000 in New Netherland and France had 3,000 in New France. Spain, had 20,000 across Texas, Mexico, Arizona, Florida, and California.   
English shored up the populus by encouraging social rebels, religiouse dissenters, and the homeless and landless to migrate to America. England even shipped some 50,000 British convicts to America as servants for hire, as well as several thousand royalist prisioners (mostly Scotts). Suprisingly, most did well in America. 
Biggest payoff for colonist was the offering of land and promise of a better life.
