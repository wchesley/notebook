# DMZ Demilitarized Zone

The point is that the internal firewall only allows specific traffic between DMZ servers and internal servers. If a DMZ server is compromised, it will only be able to contact (f.e.) one server on one TCP port, not any server on any service.

[From Spiceworks](https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/400484-so-i-ve-been-asked-to-set-up-a-dmz-but-allow-access-to-the-internal-network)

Having worked and helped design DMZ networks for companies that require high levels of security, and having worked side-by-side with Sr Security Officers with high government clearances, I have come to the following conclusions:

1) Users should never directly touch content serving web servers

2) publicly accessed servers should never have direct access to internal networks or systems

3) Web servers should never directly touch Database servers

How is this achieved?

1) Reverse proxy all incoming internet requests to your various web services (HTTP,HTTPS,FTP,Mail).  Keep reverse proxies on their own subnets, separate from other web server subnets.

2) Create a middle ground network that sits between your DMZ and Internal Networks.  This network will host your business and data layers for your web architecture, which will be given access to your backend DB servers.

3) Offload your business and data layers from your web servers to dedicated business data processing servers (such as JDBC for Apache, and WCF services for IIS).  Your web servers will contact these servers through a less benign protocol, such as HTTP or HTTPS, and the applications will be coded to make SQL/MySQL calls to your internal DB servers.

In most cases, the solutions I provided here are free Open Source software.  The only exception is the WCF service used as a business layer for ISS web servers.  Everything else is open source.

Depends on the protocol being used and what kind of safetylevel you much achieve in the segmentation/isolation of that LAN.

The most simple solution is that only the DMZ-server is allowed to do the inbound connection to a specific host on the LAN.

A better solution, but not always possible, is if the LAN host is in charge of when and how the data is being fetched from the DMZ.

Then how you will allow this traffic can occur at either the simpliest way of an ACL (srcip + srcport(range) + dstip + dstport must match) to NGFW (also appid must match) to proxybased firewall (the payload will be totally reconstructed according to the protocol being used) to datadiode (only oneway communication is possible).

There are several datadiodes available, just to mention a few:

https://www.fox-it.com/datadiode/

https://www.advenica.com/en/cds/securicds-data-diode

Also when it comes to datadioes there are the more "simple" ones (basically transform the needed traffic into a UDP stream which is then pushed over a oneway fiberlink (TX at one end and RX in the other)) to more advanced ones who basically is a proxy <-> datadiode <-> proxy setup in the same box which gives that you can "emulate" bidrectional flows (even if the flow actually is strictly one way over that oneway fiberlink).

> Where `datadiode` == guarantee that data can only physically be sent in one direction. Normally in to a sensitive network (but not leaving this sensitive network since the data you dont want to leave exists on this sensitive network). 

# ChatGPT Notes: 
**Introduction and Context:**

A Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) is crucial in enterprise networks to enhance security by segregating and isolating external-facing services from the internal network. This minimizes the potential impact of security breaches and provides an additional layer of defense. The challenges addressed by a DMZ include:

1. **External Threat Mitigation:** DMZs protect internal networks by providing a buffer zone that limits direct access to sensitive resources, reducing the attack surface for external threats.

2. **Security Segmentation:** They facilitate the segmentation of network resources, allowing for controlled communication between internal, DMZ, and external networks.

3. **Regulated Access:** DMZs enable the controlled exposure of specific services to the internet while maintaining stringent access controls.

**Palo Alto Firewall Configuration:**

a. **Setting up Zones and Interfaces:**
   - Define zones for internal, DMZ, and external networks.
   - Assign interfaces to respective zones on the Palo Alto firewall.

   For detailed steps, refer to the [Palo Alto documentation on zone and interface configuration](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-0/pan-os-web-interface-help/network/network-interfaces/ethernet-interface-overview).

b. **Security Policies:**
   - Create policies that allow or deny traffic between zones.
   - Implement policies for threat prevention, including antivirus, anti-spyware, and URL filtering.

   Refer to the [Palo Alto documentation on security policies](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-0/pan-os-web-interface-help/policies).

c. **Threat Prevention Features:**
   - Enable and configure threat prevention features like WildFire for advanced threat detection.

   Find detailed instructions in the [Palo Alto Threat Prevention documentation](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-0/pan-os-web-interface-help/threat).

Q1: How can we fine-tune the threat prevention features on the Palo Alto firewall for specific DMZ requirements?

Q2: Are there any considerations for implementing security policies that we need to be aware of when dealing with a DMZ?

Q3: In what scenarios would we need to modify zones and interfaces after the initial setup?

**Cisco Switch Configuration:**

a. **Configuring VLANs:**
   - Define VLANs to isolate DMZ traffic.
   - Assign switch ports to the appropriate VLANs.

   Follow the [Cisco documentation on VLAN configuration](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/lan-switching/inter-vlan-routing/41860-howto-L3-intervlanrouting.html).

b. **Access Control Lists (ACLs):**
   - Create ACLs to control traffic within the DMZ and between DMZ and internal networks.
   - Apply ACLs to relevant interfaces.

   Refer to the [Cisco documentation on ACLs](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/ios-firewall/23602-confaccesslists.html).

c. **VLAN Tagging and Trunking:**
   - Understand and configure VLAN tagging on switch ports.
   - Implement trunking to allow multiple VLANs to communicate.

   Explore the [Cisco guide on VLANs and trunking](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/lan-switching/inter-vlan-routing/17056-741-4.html).

Q1: How do we ensure proper VLAN segmentation while allowing necessary communication within the DMZ?

Q2: What considerations should be taken into account when designing ACLs for DMZ security?

Q3: How can we troubleshoot VLAN-related issues on the Cisco switch during or after implementation?

**Nginx Web Server Setup:**
