# Phishing

Phishing is a cybercrime where attackers impersonate trusted entities (like banks or companies) through emails, texts, or calls, using deceptive messages to trick victims into revealing sensitive data (passwords, credit card info) or installing malware, often by creating urgency or fear, to steal money, commit identity theft, or gain network access. These attacks use social engineering to exploit human psychology, directing users to fake websites that look real, making them vulnerable to data theft or system compromise.

## How Phishing Works

- Impersonation: Scammers pretend to be a familiar company, government agency, or even a colleague.
- Deception: They send messages (email, SMS, etc.) with a compelling story, like suspicious activity or a fake invoice, to create urgency or trust.
- Malicious Payload/Link: The message contains a malicious link to a fake website (a "spoofed" site) or an attachment.
- Data Theft/Malware: Clicking the link leads to a fake login page to steal credentials, or downloads malware (like ransomware) onto the user's device. 

### Common Types of Phishing

- Spear Phishing: Highly targeted attacks using personalized info about the victim.
- Whaling: Targets high-profile individuals (executives).
- Vishing: Phishing via voice calls.
- Smishing: Phishing via SMS text messages.
- QR Code Phishing (Quishing): Using malicious QR codes to redirect users. 

### How to Recognize & Protect Yourself

- Be Suspicious: Unexpected messages about account problems or urgent actions are red flags.
- Check the Sender: Hover over links to see the actual URL; it often won't match the supposed sender.
- Don't Click: Avoid clicking links or opening attachments from unknown sources.
- Go Directly: Instead of clicking links, go directly to the company's website or app.
- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Adds an extra security layer. 

### How to Report Phishing

- Report Phishing Emails: Most email providers (Gmail, Outlook) have a "Report Phishing/Spam" button.
- Report to Companies: Forward phishing emails to the company being impersonated (e.g., phishing@bankname.com).
- Report to FTC: Report scams to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at reportfraud.ftc.gov

## Best Practices to Avoid Phishing Scams (All Types)

**Stop, look, think**

Never react immediately to high-pressure messages.

**Verify using a separate channel**

If an email seems odd, contact the person via:

- Corporate chat
- Known phone number
- Face-to-face

Never reply directly to suspicious messages.

Check the sender’s address carefully

Look for:

- Extra characters
- Misspelled domains
- Non-company addresses posing as internal

Hover over links before clicking

Ensure the URL:

-  Matches the expected domain
- Uses HTTPS
- Doesn’t redirect through unknown tracking sites

Treat unexpected attachments as dangerous

Even common formats (.pdf, .docx) can be weaponized.

Don’t share MFA codes or passwords

No legitimate employee, vendor, or IT representative will ever ask for:

- One-time passcodes
- MFA tokens
- Passwords
- VPN credentials

**Use caution with QR codes.** They can send you to malicious sites or install mobile malware.

Report suspicious messages immediately

Use your company’s phishing reporting tool or send to Security.
Reporting helps protect the entire organization.

## Summary

AI phishing is more realistic, more personalized, and more dangerous than ever.
But the defenses remain simple:

Slow down. Verify. Never trust unexpected requests.
Always report anything suspicious.
