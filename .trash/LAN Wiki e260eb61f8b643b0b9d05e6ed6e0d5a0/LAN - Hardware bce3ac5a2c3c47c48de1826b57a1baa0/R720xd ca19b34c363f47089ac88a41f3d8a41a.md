### OPERATING SYSTEM 
TrueNAS vs. Ubuntu

## Storage

12 total drive bays

Currently have ZFS in mirror, needs benchmarking to see iops

Ideally I'd like to add one more 2TB drive, then reconfigure the storage to be zraid10 - 2x mirrors combined into a stripe. To migrate the data I will have to separate the currently mirrored drives and resliver them with the other two drives, then combine those two pools into a striped array.
